summary: FlashS uses random Fourier features for scalable spatial variable gene detection.
description: |
  FlashS (Frequency-domain Linearized Adaptive Spatial Hypothesis testing via Sketching)
  detects spatially variable genes using random Fourier feature projections. It employs a
  two-part test combining binary (presence/absence) and rank (intensity) spatial patterns,
  merged via Cauchy combination. The method achieves O(nnz * D) time and O(D) memory per
  gene, where D is the number of Fourier features and nnz is the number of expressing cells,
  making it highly scalable for large spatial transcriptomics datasets.
